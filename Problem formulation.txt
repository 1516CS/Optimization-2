Decision variables:
	X = Number of Caravans per night in the park	
	Y = Number of Tents per night in the park
		
Objective: Maximize the total profit per night from Caravans and Tents
Objective function:   Profit = 30X + 15Y

Business constrains:
	Total allocated space:   160X + 90Y <= 1800
	Maximum number of Caravans:   X <= 6
	Total Park occupancy:   4X + 3Y <= 48 (*Assuming each caravan and tent has maximum allowed number of occupants)
	Non- negativity:     X, Y >= 0
