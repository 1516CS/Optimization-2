# Linear Programming for a caravan park management
This case study explores optimizing the operations of a small caravan park to maximize profit per night by effectively allocating space for caravans and tents while adhering to several operational and business constraints.

#### Scenario Overview
The caravan park has a total available area of 1800m² with specific space, pricing, and occupancy restrictions:

Caravans: Require 160m², charge $30 per night, and accommodate a maximum of 4 people. A maximum of 6 caravans can be allowed per night.
Tents: Require 90m², charge $15 per night, and accommodate up to 3 people.
Occupancy Limit: The total park occupancy must not exceed 48 people per night.

#### Analysis Focus
The study identifies the optimal number of caravans and tents that the park can accommodate to achieve the maximum profit per night, considering all business and operational constraints.

#### Additional Sensitivity Analyses
Price Increases: Assessing the impact of increasing caravan and tent prices by 100% independently.
Relaxed Caravan Restrictions: Allowing a 50% increase in the number of caravans.
COVID Restrictions: Evaluating the impact of a reduced park occupancy limit of 30 people.

By leveraging linear programming, this case study provides data-driven recommendations that enable effective decision-making to balance profit, space allocation, and customer satisfaction while addressing potential changes in business scenarios.
