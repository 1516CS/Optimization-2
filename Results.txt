Considering all the business constraints of caravan park management, the optimized solution for maximizing profit per night is as follows:

Optimized Allocation:
	Optimal Number of Caravans per Night (X): 6
	Optimal Number of Tents per Night (Y): 8
	Maximum Possible Profit per Night: $300

Resource Utilization:
Total Space Allocation: Space Used: 160m² * 6 + 90m² * 8 = 1680m²
Unused Space: 120m²

Total Occupancy:
Occupants: 4 * 6 + 3 * 8 = 48 (Maximum allowable occupancy fully utilized)

The caravan park can achieve a nightly profit of $300 by accommodating 6 caravans (the maximum allowed) and 8 tents. The total space used will be 1680m², leaving 120m² unused. The occupancy reaches the maximum limit of 48 people, ensuring full utilization of this constraint.


Scenario Analysis
Based on sensitivity analysis, various scenarios were explored to understand their impact on the nightly profit:

Scenario 1: Increasing the Price for Caravans by 100%
	New Caravan Price: $60 per night
	Range of Optimality: [$20 – $1030]

Updated Profit:
	Caravans: $60 * 6 = $360
	Tents: $15 * 8 = $120

Total: $480

By doubling the price for caravans, the park can increase profit by $180 per night, resulting in a total nightly profit of $480 without altering the optimal allocation of 6 caravans and 8 tents.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scenario 2: Increasing the Price for Tents by 100%
	New Tent Price: $30 per night	
	Range of Optimality: [$0 – $22.5]

Updated Allocation and Profit:
	Caravans: 0
	Tents: 16
	Profit: $30 * 16 = $480

While a 100% price increase for tents is outside the range of optimality for the original solution, re-optimizing results in a nightly profit of $480. However, the park will not accommodate any caravans, leaving 360m² unused.

Scenario 3: Allowing 50% More Caravans
	Maximum Allowed Caravans: 9
	Updated Profit:

New Total Profit: $330

Updated Allocation:
	Caravans: 9
	Tents: 4

Increasing the maximum allowed caravans to 9 increases the profit to $330 per night, fully utilizing the available space and adhering to occupancy constraints.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scenario 4: Implementing COVID Restrictions (Limit Total Occupancy to 30)

Updated Allocation and Profit:
	Caravans: 6
	Tents: 2

Profit Reduction: $5 * 18 = –$90
New Total Profit: $210
Unused Space: 660m²

Reducing the total occupancy to 30 significantly reduces the nightly profit by $90 and leaves 660m² of space unused. This highlights the trade-off between profitability and adhering to public health measures.

Conclusion

This analysis provides an optimal allocation plan for caravans and tents to maximize profit for a caravan park spanning 1800m². Under standard constraints, the park can achieve a profit of $300 per night by allocating 6 caravans and 8 tents, utilizing 1680m² of space and accommodating 48 people.

Key insights include:

Price Adjustments: Doubling caravan or tent prices can increase nightly profits to $480. However, reallocation of space may result in unused capacity.
Caravan Capacity: Allowing 50% more caravans (up to 9) can increase profit to $330, fully utilizing resources.
COVID Restrictions: Reducing total occupancy to 30 decreases profit to $210 per night and leaves significant space unused.
To enhance profitability, the park should consider adjusting pricing and increasing caravan capacity while carefully balancing public health and operational constraints.
